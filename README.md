# rpi-percona

This is a fork of [rpi-mysql](https://github.com/hypriot/rpi-mysql). Runs Percona 5.7 on top of Arch Linux ARM, intended to be run on Raspberry PI.

### But nobody wants to run this in production!

Maybe, but it was a fun experiment to see if it was possible to get Percona running on RPI Docker!
